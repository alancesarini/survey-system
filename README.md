# survey-system

## About this project
This is a basic project to create and manage surveys. Each survey has its own unique url so that users can access and fill it.

## Stack used
I used the MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack to build this project. I used Webpack to bundle all together.

## Quickstart
In the root folder of the project run `npm run start` to start the ReactJS frontend. In the backend folder, run `npm run dev` to start the NodeJS server. You also need a MongoDB server running.
In the `backend/config` folder there is a `.env` file. In this file you can configure the port NodeJS will run on and the url to the MongoDB server.
